The **Ottoman Empire**,[\[k]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire#cite_note-35) historically and colloquially known as the **Turkish Empire**,[\[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire#cite_note-36) was an empire[\[l]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire#cite_note-37) that controlled much of [Southeast Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Europe "Southeast Europe"), [Western Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Asia "Western Asia"), and [Northern Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa "North Africa") between the 14th and early 20th centuries. It was founded at the end of the 13th century in northwestern [Anatolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia "Anatolia") in the town of [Söğüt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B6%C4%9F%C3%BCt "Söğüt") (modern-day [Bilecik Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilecik_Province "Bilecik Province")) by the [Turkoman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkoman_(ethnonym) "Turkoman (ethnonym)")[\[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire#cite_note-38) tribal leader [Osman I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osman_I "Osman I").[\[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire#cite_note-39) After 1354, the Ottomans crossed into Europe and, with the [conquest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_wars_in_Europe "Ottoman wars in Europe") of the [Balkans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans "Balkans"), the Ottoman [beylik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolian_beyliks "Anatolian beyliks") was transformed into a transcontinental empire. The Ottomans ended the [Byzantine Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire "Byzantine Empire") with the [conquest of Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople "Fall of Constantinople") in 1453 by [Mehmed II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmed_II "Mehmed II").[\[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire#cite_note-Quataert2005-40)

Under the reign of [Suleiman the Magnificent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suleiman_the_Magnificent "Suleiman the Magnificent"), the Ottoman Empire marked the peak of its power and prosperity, as well as the highest development of its governmental, social, and economic systems.[\[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire#cite_note-41) At the beginning of the 17th century, the empire contained [32 provinces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_the_Ottoman_Empire "Administrative divisions of the Ottoman Empire") and numerous [vassal states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vassal_and_tributary_states_of_the_Ottoman_Empire "Vassal and tributary states of the Ottoman Empire"). Some of these were later absorbed into the Ottoman Empire, while others were granted various types of autonomy over the course of centuries.[\[m]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire#cite_note-43) With [Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Istanbul#Ottoman_Empire "History of Istanbul") (modern-day [Istanbul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul "Istanbul")) as its capital and control of lands around the [Mediterranean Basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Basin "Mediterranean Basin"), the Ottoman Empire was at the centre of interactions between the [Middle East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East "Middle East") and Europe for six centuries.

While the empire was once thought to have entered a period of [decline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Decline_Thesis "Ottoman Decline Thesis") following the death of Suleiman the Magnificent, this view is no longer supported by the majority of academic historians.[\[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire#cite_note-decline-44) The newer academic consensus posits that the empire continued to maintain a flexible and strong economy, society and military throughout the 17th and for much of the 18th century.[\[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire#cite_note-45) However, during a long period of peace from 1740 to 1768, the Ottoman military system fell behind that of its European rivals, the [Habsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habsburg_monarchy "Habsburg monarchy") and [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire "Russian Empire") empires.[\[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire#cite_note-AksanOW-46) The Ottomans consequently suffered severe military defeats in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The successful [Greek War of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_War_of_Independence "Greek War of Independence") concluded with [decolonization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decolonization#Ottoman_Empire "Decolonization") of Greece following the [London Protocol (1830)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Protocol_(1830) "London Protocol (1830)") and [Treaty of Constantinople (1832)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Constantinople_(1832) "Treaty of Constantinople (1832)"). This and other defeats prompted the Ottoman state to initiate a comprehensive process of reform and modernization known as the [Tanzimat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzimat "Tanzimat"). Thus, over the course of the 19th century, the Ottoman state became vastly more powerful and organized internally, despite suffering further territorial losses, especially in the Balkans, where a number of new states emerged.[\[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire#cite_note-47)
